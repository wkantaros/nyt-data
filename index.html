    <p>We all read news with implicit biases. From our own political views to those of news sources' and reporters',
      attempting to escape political, social, or other frames is futile. Whether we’re watching a fifteen-second TV ad
      or reading a carefully laid-out newspaper, the frame imposed on the content dissuades us from thinking, or nudges
      us toward predetermined thought patterns. In news, the sum of our experiences preceding <em>what</em> we read
      determines <em>how</em> we read it. We know this, which is why many actively try to read political articles from
      both the left and right. This leads to my question: <strong>Why don't we recognize these same frames in
        gender?</strong></p>
    <p>We each view the world through our own set of internal frames, shaped by our individual experiences and by the
      words we’ve heard and uttered. Men and women have biological disparities, affecting their outlooks and how they
      shape their news. More importantly, the social landscapes for both genders vastly differ: from how they're raised,
      how they're spoken to, and societal pressures placed on them, men and women view the world through divergent
      lenses. And if only one gender reports information, we only see one side of the truth.</p>
    <p>I look at <em>The New York Times</em>, widely revered as the paragon of the news industry, to determine whether
      their articles are written by an equal distribution of genders. </p>
    <!-- <h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2> -->
    <p>In order to determine whether an imbalance exists between articles written by men and women, we need to look
      at the number of articles written by each gender.</p>

    <p>The graph above shows that male authors heavily dominate writing at The New York Times. Men consistently double
      or nearly triple women in total articles written every month. In January, 2012, men wrote 7,290 articles - the
      greatest number of articles written by a single gender in a month. For comparison, during that same month women
      wrote a measly 3,554 articles, or a little over 32% of the total articles. Eight years later, the gender gap at
      The Times remains unchanged. of gender discrepancies at The Times.</p>
    <p>It is also worth noting the heavy reduction in total articles over the last seven years. The Times released
      12,069 articles at its peak in January, 2012. Over the ensuing years, that number has plummeted. In December,
      2017, the newspaper published only 991 articles, or 8% of what was produced nearly seven years earlier.</p>
    <p>Within The Times, gender distributions fluctuate between topic sections, as shown in the figure below. </p>

  </div>
  <div class="notIframe">
    <p>Although some topic sections have a relatively normal gender distribution, a far greater number fails to meet
      this same level of equality. Several sections contain more female writers, including Real Estate, Travel, and
      Fashion, but these sections publish fewer articles per month in comparison to other Times' sections. In fact, men
      predominantly write the top seven topic sections, which include US, World, Arts, Business, and Opinion.</p>
    <p>In December, 2016, women wrote only a quarter of the articles in the Opinion section. In a section dedicated to
      free thought, it is concerning to see The Times release articles based primarily on only the perspectives of men.
    </p>
    <!-- <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> -->
    <p>When people consume information from a homogeneous source, they develop blindspots; they are deprived of fresh
      ideas, new cultures, and diverging opinions as a consequence. As the amount of news distributed to the American
      people from The Times has diminished, the increased concentration of voices only exacerbates current gender
      disparities. Not to be confused, The Times has established themselves as a reputatable source for their ability
      to release quality content to the public. However, we must be cognizant of their blindspots. Much
      like the rise of suburban America in the 1950s, where provincial ideas resonated off one other like a soundboard
      for white America, a concentrated male-dominated news perpetrated by the New York Times leaves Americans in
      uniform thought, and leaves women without representation. And when the distributors of information are only a few,
      homogeneous voices, democracy and the progress of this nation halts. Although the absence of free news can cripple
      a nation, a trusted news source with concealed biases, like The New York Times, can trigger pernicious and equally
      damaging consequences.

    <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
    <p>I accumulated every New York Times article written over the last 7 years, which totaled to be over 500,000
      articles. From each article, I extracted the first name of the main author and the "section_type," the topic
      name that the New York Times attributed
      to the article.</p>
    <p>Although I had a list of the authors' first names, the New York Times did not explicitly state their genders.
      To resolve this issue, I created an algorithm that searches through the US Social Security name database to
      predict gender. For names like
      Tracy and Alex, which can fall into either category, the algorithm checks which gender is more popular for
      that name, and places it into that group. If the name cannot be categorized into a gender with at least a 60%
      certainty, or if the name isn't
      in the database at all, the algorithm omits the name to insure accurate data. Roughly 5% of the data was not
      included in my analysis for these reasons.</p>
